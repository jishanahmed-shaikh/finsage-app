## Inspiration

FinSage was born from a recognition of the significant challenges many individuals face when managing their investments and financial decisions. We observed that:

1. Financial literacy remains inaccessible to many, creating barriers to effective investing
2. Existing portfolio management tools are often complex and intimidating for beginners
3. High-quality financial advice traditionally requires expensive advisors or extensive self-education

We envisioned a platform that could democratize financial intelligence by combining cutting-edge AI technology with intuitive design, making sophisticated portfolio management accessible to everyone - from beginners to seasoned investors.
